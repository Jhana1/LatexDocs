\section{Project Description}
My final year project aims to create a set of static code/compiler analytics tools to help determine which algorithms within a codebase may be easily parallelized. The specific intention it to provide users with a report describing which parts of their codebase may see a potential speed-up from redeveloping them as CUDA (GPU) kernels. In order to achieve this both benchmarking and theoretical analysis is required, as well as static analysis of the C description of the algorithm itself.

\section{Major Accomplishments}
The key accomplishments thus far in this project have been a combination of knowledge based as well as code output based. The beginning of this project was characterised by a steep learning curve, in order to write General Purpose GPU code to complete the project. Additionally the other component, that of the static code analyser also involved a steep learning curve, with further research and testing with the Clang Abstract Syntax Tree, through Clang LibTooling. Following these learning phases the major accomplishments of the project so far are:
